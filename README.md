# Week4Homework!! Lets test that random knowledge.


I kept the HTML barebones honestly because the JS took up so much of my time. This was a tough one but with some elbow grease pulled it off. Had to find out some things on stackoverflow, and my friend who is a full stack developer helped me through some local storage elements. I feel like I get it and then look away from it for a day and its gone! I actually think the questions I made are tough. Enjoy!
